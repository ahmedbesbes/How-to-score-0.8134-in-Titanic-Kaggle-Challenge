### How to score 0.8134 in Titanic Kaggle Challenge

The Titanic challenge on Kaggle is a competition in which the task is to predict the survival or the death of a given passenger based on a set of variables describing him such as his age, his sex, or his passenger class on the boat.
I have been playing with the Titanic dataset for a while, and I have recently achieved an accuracy score of 0.8134 on the public leaderboard.
As I'm writing this post, I am ranked among the top 9% of all Kagglers: More than 4540 teams are currently competing.

In a form of a jupyter notebook, my solution goes through the basic steps of a data science pipeline: 

- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Data cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Modeling 
- Modelfine-tuning
